    <h2>Who am I?</h2>
    <p>My name is <b>Abhijith Saju</b>. I am a second-year Computer Science Engineering student at Amal Jyothi College of Engineering. My journey started with a curiosity about how software works, which led me to learn Java and Python. Recently, I realized that functionality needs to look good too, so I started exploring UI/UX design using Figma. I love bridging the gap between complex backend logic and beautiful frontend design."</p>

    <h2>What Drives Me</h2>
    <p>My passion for technology extends beyond the syntax of a programming language; it is rooted in the belief that effective software is the perfect synergy of logical architecture and human-centric design. 
        As a Computer Science student, I have dedicated my academic journey to mastering this balance. On one hand, I enjoy the rigorous challenge of backend development—structuring efficient algorithms in Java and Python to solve complex data problems. 
        On the other, I recognize that powerful code is useless if it isn't accessible. This realization sparked my interest in UI/UX design, leading me to explore tools like Figma to better understand the user journey. What drives me is the opportunity to merge these two worlds: creating applications that are not only technically robust and scalable under the hood but are also intuitive and engaging for the end-user. 
        I am committed to continuous learning and am eager to apply this multidisciplinary approach to solve real-world engineering challenges.</p>
